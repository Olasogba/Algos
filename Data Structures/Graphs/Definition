What is a Graph?
- A graph is a collection of nodes and connections between those nodes

USES FOR GRAPHS
- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing Alogrithms
- Visual Hierachy
- File System Optimizations

Graph terms:
- Vertex: a node
- Edge: connection between nodes
- Weighted/Unweighted: values assigned to distances
- Directed/Undirected: directions assigned to distance between vertices

TWO WAYS OF STORING GRAPHS:
- The adjacency matrix:
    - Can take up less space (in sparse graphs)
    - Faster to iterate over all edges
    - Can be slower to look up specific edges
- The adjecency list
    - Takes up more space (in sparse graphs)
    - Slower to iterate over all edges
    - Faster to look up specific edge

GRAPH TRAVERSAL USES
- Peer to peer networking
- Web crawlers
- Finding "closest" matches/recommendations
- Shortest path problems
    - GPS Navigations
    - Solving mazes
    - AI (shortest path to win the game)

GRAPH - DFS
- Follow neighours before, reach a dead end, then backtrack
