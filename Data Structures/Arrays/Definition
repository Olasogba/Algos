What is a static Array?
A static array is a !fixed length container containing n elements indexable
from the range [0, n-1]

When and where is a static Array used?
- Storing and accessing sequential data
- Temporarily storing objects
- Used by IO routines as buffers
- Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
- Can be used to return multiple values from a function
- Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems
- etc

DYNAMIC ARRAY
- The dynamic array can grow and shrink in size.

How to implement a dynamic Arrau:
- Create a static array with an initial capacity
- Add elements to the underlying static array, keeping track of the number
  of elements
- If adding another element wil exceed the capacity, then create a new
  static array with twice the capacity and copy the original elements into
  it
