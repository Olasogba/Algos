- A data structure that contains a head, tail, and length property

- Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to 
  another node or null

- Singly Linked Lists are an excellent alterntive to arrays when insertion and
  deletion ar the beginning are frequently required

- Arrays contain a built in index whereas Linked Lists do not.

- The idea of a list data structure that consisits of nodes is the foundation
  for other data structures like Stacks and Queues.

  COMPARISON WITH ARRAYS
  Lists:
  - Do not have indexes
  - Connected via nodes with a next pointer
  - Random access is not allowed

  Arrays:
  - Indexed in order
  - Insertion and deletion can be expensive
  - Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
