What is a Binary Heap?
- Very similar to binary seach tree, but with some different rules!
- In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes.
- In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

Xteristics
- Each parent has at most two child nodes
- The valie of of each parent node is greater than its child nodes.
- In a max Binary Heap, the parent is greater than the children, but there
  are no guarantees between sibling nodes
- A binary heap is a compact as possible. All the children of each node are
  as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

USES
- Binary Heaps are used to implement Priproty Queues, which are very commonly
  used data structures.
- They are also used quite a bit, with graph traversal algorithms

STORING HEAPS
THERE'S AN EASY WAY OF STORING A BINARY HEAP -> A LIST/ARRAY
1.
    - For any index of an array n...
    - The left child is stored at 2n+1
    - The right child is at 2n+2

2.
    - For any child node at index n...
    - Its parent is at index Math.floor((n-1)/2)


REMOVING FROM HEAPS
- Remove the root
- Replace the most recently added
- Adjust (sink down)

PRIORITY QUEUES
- A data structure where each elemenet has a priority. Elements with higher
  priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.
