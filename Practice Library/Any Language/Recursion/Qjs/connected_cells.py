Given a matrix, each of which may be 1 or 0. The filled cells that are connected
form a region. Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other
horizontally, vertically or diagonall. There may be several regions in the matrix.
How do you find the larfest region (in terms of number of cells) in the matrix?

Sample input:
