* All possible solutions (not bothering about optimization)
* In how many ways?

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions 
to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, 
that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a 
candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate 
cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.[1]

Backtracking is an important tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems
 such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, Sudoku, and many other puzzles. It is 
 often the most convenient (if not the most efficient[citation needed]) 
 technique for parsing,[3] for the knapsack problem and other --COMBINATORIAL --
 optimization problems. It is also the basis of the so-called logic programming 
 languages such as Icon, Planner and Prolog.
