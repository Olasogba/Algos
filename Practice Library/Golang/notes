A Kubernetes operator is an application-specific controller that extends the functionality of the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex applications on behalf of a Kubernetes user.

The site reliability engineer or operations team typically writes the software to 
manage an application, but an operator is designed to take human operational knowledge 
and encode it into software to manage and deploy Kubernetes workloads while eliminating manual tasks. 

The creation of an operator often starts with automating the applicationâ€™s installation and self-service provisioning, and follows with more complex automation capabilities.

There is also a Kubernetes operator software development kit (SDK) that can help you develop your own operator. 
The SDK provides the tools to build, test, and package operators with a choice of creating operators using Helm 
charts, Ansible Playbooks or Golang
