Variables
---------
Approach - Devise a plan for solving every problem. Before writing a line of code, how do you approach a new problem
Patterns - Identify and study common patterns
Questions - Solve plenty questions

Study structure
---------------
- Attempt solving one to three on code signal every morning, spend no more than one hour.
- Study and take notes (you can try your hands on questions here and there during the study session) - for 2 hours intermittently
- Attempt solving Microsoft problems on LeetCode (towards the end of your syllabus, as you will need the techniques contained in the course).

Types of Patterns
-----------------
- Custom patterns: Patterns that don't really belong in established patterns
- Established patterns: Patterns that have an established methodology.

Study plan
---------
(Custom patterns first, then Established patterns)
- For each pattern identified,
1. Note down the definition of the pattern
2. Understand the pattern
2. List out the questions you come across that identifies with that pattern.
3. Practice solving the questions under every pattern everyday. This way, the patterns will be mastered and then solving the problems would only be easy and straightforward.

NOTE: THE GOAL IS NOT TO MEMORIZE PATTERNS, BUT RATHER TO master them so you don't have to try to remember them. In other words, follow the above, but
also make sure to attempt and solve as many questions as possible covering all the patterns (14?).

Erichto
1.Practice, solve problems
2.If you don't know algorithms, you can go start to solve problems which have editorials: problems that have an analysis by the author.
Maybe for the first time you will encounter DFS, then google DFS, solve a few more problems on DFS and you can go back to randomly solving problems.
3.Choose levels slightly above your comfort zone, slightly above your level
4.Solve a lot of problems
5.He recommends for begginers and medium level participants, after being stuck for about 20-30 minutes, to look at the answer. Read the answer till the end, if you need.
