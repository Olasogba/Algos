This repo is arranged to be used in the following manner:

- Patterns listed under the Custom Patterns directory may be first practiced and mastered.
- More difficult patterns like ones listed under the Established Patterns directory may be practiced too.

===
- All solution files should be kept clean and should only contain the best answers to their corresponding problems.
- Practice may only be done in the question files.
- All code must be clean. No unnecessary comments, except to pass a message across, comment your code block with your name so we know you're the author.
