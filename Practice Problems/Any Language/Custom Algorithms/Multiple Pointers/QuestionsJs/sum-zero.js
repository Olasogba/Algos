`
    Write a function called sumZero which accepts a !(sorted)! array of
    intergers. The fn should find the first pair where the sum is 0.
    Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or
    undefined if a pair does not exist.

    sumZero([-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,5])
    
`
log = (...val)=>console.log(...val)
function sumZero(array) {
   
}

console.log(sumZero([2,7,11,15])) // undefined
log(sumZero([-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,5]))
