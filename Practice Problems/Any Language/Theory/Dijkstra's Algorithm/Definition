- Finds the shorted path between two vertices on a graph

USEFULNESS
- GPS - Finding fasted route
- Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
Biology - used to model the spead of viruses among humnas
- Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination


THE APPROACH
- Everytime we look to visit a new node, we pick the node with the smallest 
  known distance to visit first

- Once we've moved to the node we're going to visit, we look at each of its
  neighbours

- For each neighbouring node, we calculate the distance by summing the total
  edges that lead to the node we're checking from the starting node

- If the new total distance to a node is less than the previous total, we 
  store the new shorter distance for that node.
