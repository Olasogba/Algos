 * A group of fiends are playing a video game together. During the game, each player
 * earns a nimber of points. At the end of a round, players who achieve a certain
 * rank get to "level up" their characters to gain increased abilities. Given the 
 * scores of the platers at the end of a round, how many players will be able to
 * level up
 * 
 * NOTE: Players with equal scores will have equal ranks, but the player with the
 * next lower score will be ranked based on the position within the list of all
 * player's scores. For example, if there are four players, and three players tie
 * for first place, their rankss are 1,1,1, and 4.
