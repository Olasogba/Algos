Data Structures are collections of values, the relationships among them,
and the functions or operations that be applied to the data.

A Data Structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectvely

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data strucutre which provides
only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.
The interface does not give any specific details about how something should
be implemented or in what programming language

Examples:
Abstraction (ADT) -> Implementation(DS)
List -> Dynamic Array, Linked List
Queue -> Linked List based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue
Map -> Tree Map, Hash Map/Hash Table
Vehicle -> Golf Cart, Bicycle, Smart Car

Linearithmic Time: O(nlog(n))
Quadratic Time: O(n**2)
Cubic Time: O(n**3)
Exponential Time: O(b*n), b > 1
Factorial Time: o(n!)
