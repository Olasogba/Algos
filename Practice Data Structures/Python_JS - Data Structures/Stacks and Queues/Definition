What is a Stack?
- A LIFO data structure!

- The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed
  from the stack

USED IN:
- Managing function invocations
- Undo / Redo
- Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack!
- Tree/Graph algorithms

WAYS TO IMPLEMENT
- Array Implementation (easiest) - push/pop || shift/unshift (v!)
- Linked List Implementation
- Writing from scratch

BIG O of STACKS
- Insertion - O(1)
- Removal - O(1)
- Searching - O(N) -> you should use some other data structure
- Access - O(N) -> Stacks prioritize only insertion and removal

What is a Queue?
- A FIFO data structure!

- The first element added to the stack will be the first element removed
  from the stack

USED IN:
- Background Tasks
- Uploading Resources
- Printing/Task processing

WAYS TO IMPLEMENT
- Array Implementation (easiest) - push/shift(v!) || unshift/pop -> enqueue/dequeue
- Linked List Implementation
- Writing from scratch

BIG O
- Smae as above
