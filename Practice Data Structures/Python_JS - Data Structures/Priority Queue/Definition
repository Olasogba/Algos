What is a Priority Queue?
- A data structure where each element has a priority. Elements with higher 
  priorities are served before elemenets with lower priorities

Priority Queues may be implemented in different ways, each with different effeciency
- Linked list implementation: Elements are sorted in the linked list based on their priority
- Array implementation -> push/shift but the Array.sort() fn is used to sort the list after any insertion
- Binary heap implementation -> A min binary heap
