* Binary Search only works on sorted arrays.

Time Complexity:
- Worst and Average Case: O(log n)
  Log example: log(8) = 3; 2 to power 3 == 8
  The Logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you 
  can divide that number by 2 befor you get a value that's less than
  or equal to one.
- Best Case: O(1)
